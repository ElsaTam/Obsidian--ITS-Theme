# Image Positions
> Move/position and re-size the images in notes

**âš  Note:** 
- Obsidian internal images `![[` will change immediately, but for external images `![]()`, the page needs to be reopened to see the changes. 
- Might not be 100% compatible with [Lithou's Image Flags snippet.](https://github.com/Lithou/Sandbox/blob/main/.obsidian/snippets/pub-Image%20Flags.css)
- Image grid doesn't quite work with external images `[]()`as nicely as internally linked ones.

# Syntax

![[Internal Image.png|attribute attribute2]]
